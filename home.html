        <h1>All About Neapolitan Pizza</h1>
        <p>There are a lot of different style of pizza out there. Neapolitan style pizza is the best out of all of them. It's a traditional style of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. Known for its simple ingredients and distinctive preparation methods, it is one of the most iconic forms of pizza worldwide. The dough is made using just flour, water, salt, and yeast, and is left to ferment for at least 24 hours. It is then hand-stretched to create a thin base with a slightly thicker, airy crust.</p>
        <p>One of the defining characteristics of Neapolitan pizza is its cooking method. It is baked in a wood-fired oven at temperatures reaching around 900°F (480°C) for 60 to 90 seconds. This results in a soft, chewy crust with characteristic charred spots, known as "leopard spotting." The toppings are simple and fresh, typically including San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella) or fior di latte (cow’s milk mozzarella), fresh basil, and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.</p>
        <p>The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (AVPN) was established to preserve the traditional methods of Neapolitan pizza-making. Today, this style of pizza is recognized for its balance of flavors, light texture, and adherence to authentic techniques that reflect its cultural origins in Naples.</p>
